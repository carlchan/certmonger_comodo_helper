The files in this directory are simply examples to help configure the system:
 
 * comodo: Should be placed in /var/lib/certmonger/cas, defines the CA configuration for certmonger.
 * comodo.ini: Should be placed in /etc/certmonger and defines the login information for the comodo_client.py helper
   to use.

The comodo file in /var/lib/certmonger/cas should not need to be modified.

comodo.ini, will need to be changed to the proper values that are either generated by you through
the Comodo portal, or you can speak to a Comodo rep to generate them for you.::

    api_url= # Example: https://hard.cert-manager.com/ws/EPKIManagerSSL?wsdl>
    cert_type_name= # The prefered certificate type, example: PlatinumSSL Certificate>
    customer_login_uri= # The login uri for the customer, if you login to the Comodo Certificate Manager (CCM)
                          at https://hard.cert-manager.com/customer/foo, your URI is foo>
    login= # The login name to use
    org_id= # Your organization ID, can be found in CCM
    password= # The password for the user
    revoke_password= # A certificate revocation password (this is required though never used)
    secret_key= # You API secret key
    term= # The term you wish for your certificate to be valid in years
